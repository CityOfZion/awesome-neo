*Updated 09/26/17*

1.	Contributors will fork from a City of Zion (COZ) repository feature branch to their own user branch.
2.	Contributors will work on and refine their own version of the branch.
3.	Contributors will initiate a pull request (PR) for their changes to the COZ feature branch, upon which COZ members and the community will review the work done (including testing if necessary). 
4.	If approved by COZ, it will be merged into the COZ feature branch.
5.	The COZ feature branch will initiate a PR to the Neo master repository. 
6.	If approved by the Neo Core team, the changes will be merged into Neo master.
7.	Upon merge into Neo master, the COZ master repository will sync with Neo master and inherit all changes accepted, leaving no difference between the two.
8.	Repeat from step 1.

NOTE: All branching from COZ for feature requests will be handled by COZ. Contributors need not concern themselves with this issue.
