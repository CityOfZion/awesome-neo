# City of Zion Application Process
*Updated 09/26/17*

The **City of Zion** (**CoZ**) is a group of open source developers formed for the purpose of furthering the progress of the NEO blockchain. We are always looking for talented people to join our ranks. 

If you want to help with one of our projects, you can do it directly through GitHub. Our repository is located at https://github.com/CityOfZion. You can also join us on project specific Slack channels, access to which will be granted through an application process. Please see the form below.

In the form, please provide your preferred name (real or not), GitHub username, Slack screen name, skills, public wallet address, and what you want to specifically work on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Name**: Can be real or a screen name. 

**GitHub Username**: CoZ uses GitHub in order to collaborate and keep track of work. All developers are required to have an account. Previous work done on a GitHub account contributes to our decision-making process.

**Slack Screen Name**: CoZ uses Slack in order to collaborate with each other and report results. All developers are required to have an account.

**Public Wallet Address**: CoZ occasionally will receive funding from the community. Your public wallet address is how we send compensation for work done in these instances.

**Skills**: What programming languages are you well versed in and confident in programming in? If you are unsure of whether to add a language, then leave it unchecked. If you are an experienced translator, please record your language of expertise in the "other" box. Any other skills of interest can be recorded in "other" as well.

**What do you specifically want to work on?**: Be honest! This way, we can allocate your time more effectively.
